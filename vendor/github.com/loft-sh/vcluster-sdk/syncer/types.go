// Base is a basic entity, which identifies the action through its name. Additional
// functionality can be added to this basic identity through implementing other interfaces
// below. The functionality is additive, which means that actions that implement multiple
// interfaces are valid. The syncer, fake syncer or hook interface are not needed to get implemented
// and actions that implement for example only the Initializer or IndicesRegisterer interfaces
// are valid.

// Syncer is a controller that runs in the virtual cluster and is fed events based on
// the base object that is defined through the Base interface. vcluster will automatically
// watch on events in the host cluster and feds host cluster events into the virtual cluster
// controller by converting the involved object names based on the NameTranslator interface
// implementation. Various default implementations can be found in the translator package.

	// SyncDown defines the action that should be taken by the syncer if a virtual cluster object
	// exists, but has no corresponding physical cluster object yet. Typically, the physical cluster
	// object would get synced down from the virtual cluster to the host cluster in this scenario.
	SyncDown(ctx *context.SyncContext, vObj client.Object) (ctrl.Result, error)

	// Sync defines the action that should be taken by the syncer if a virtual cluster object and
	// physical cluster object exist and either one of them has changed. The syncer is expected
	// to reconcile in this case without knowledge of which object has actually changed. This
	// is needed to avoid race conditions and defining a clear hierarchy what fields should be managed
	// by which cluster. For example, for pods you would want to sync down (virtual -> physical)
	// spec changes, while you would want to sync up (physical -> virtual) status changes, as those
	// would get set only by the physical host cluster.

// UpSyncer adds functionality in the case a syncer needs to control the situation where
// only a physical object is present that should get somehow modified or synced into the virtual cluster.
// If this interface is not implemented by the syncer, vcluster will automatically delete the physical
// object in this case instead, as no corresponding virtual object does exist anymore.
type UpSyncer interface {
	// SyncUp defines the action that should be taken by the syncer if a physical cluster object

	// there are situations where this shouldn't be the case, for example if objects should get
	// synced from the host cluster to the virtual cluster (like nodes), in this case the syncer
	// can implement this interface to gain full control over this situation.

// FakeSyncer is a controller that runs in the virtual cluster and creates fake objects based
// on a change in a related object, that needs another object to function properly, but vcluster
// does not have access to sync this object or the object itself is not relevant. For example,
// fake syncers are used to mock nodes that are bound by pods without vcluster needing permissions
// to actually sync to those nodes. Usually a fake syncer requires events from other objects,
// so implementing the ControllerModifier interface is very common.

	// expected to exist in the virtual cluster, but does not yet exist. For example,
	// for faking nodes in the pod syncer, this would be the spec.nodeName of a pod that
	// will be fed into the fake syncer, which is then expected to create a fake node for
	// this.

// Starter allows a syncer or fake syncer to gain more control over the reconcile process
// by running an action before every reconcile and after every reconcile. This action can
// also stop the reconcile from proceeding which essentially means that through this interface
// you can bypass the default syncer logic enterily.
type Starter interface {
	// ReconcileStart is executed before the syncer or fake syncer reconcile starts and can return
	// true if the rest of the reconcile should be skipped. If an error is returned, the reconcile

// Initializer is used to initialize a certain syncer. This can be used for example to sync certain
// crds or apply manifests you'll need in the virtual cluster. This interface does not require
// the syncer or fake syncer interface to be implemented. The order in which vcluster will execute
// those before functions is:
// 1. Init()
// 2. RegisterIndices()
// 3. ModifyController() (Only if Syncer or FakeSyncer is implemented)
//
// Keep in mind that the context's managers are not started at this point, which means that accessing
// the client's will not work and new clients are needed to be generated, if kubernetes access is needed:

// and it is safe to access the ctx.VirtualManager.GetClient() or ctx.PhysicalManager.GetClient().
